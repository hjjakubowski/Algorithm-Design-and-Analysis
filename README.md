# Algorithm-Design-and-Analysis

Repository created for the course "Algorithm Design and Analysis" at the Wroclaw University of Science and Technology.

During this course, 3 mini projects will be carried out.  
The first project concerns various sorting algorithms, their construction, strengths and weaknesses and exemplary application.  
In first project, we will implement such methods as:

- quicksort sorting
- sorting by merging
- introspective sorting
